When you say \"you\" it not only means \"you\" but it also tells people what level of respect you're giving them. There are four different levels of respect you can give to a person and those are Low, Moderate, High, and Extreme Respect. When talking to a person you need to pick one of the four and be consistent throughout your life until something happens that makes you want to respect them even more or less. Also, the level of respect of \"you\" you choose governs the verb. Almost all verbs in Nepali also have 4 different ways of saying the same word but a level of respect is associated with it like the word \"you\". So, when making a sentence in Nepali, you need to match the level of respect of \"you\" with the level of respect of a verb. You can't just go with a moderate level of respect of \"you\" and a high level of respect of a verb and make a sentence. It will be grammatically incorrect in Nepali. Furthermore, saying \"you\" in Nepali becomes a little harder when more than one English words make up one word in Nepali.  Let's take a look at all four levels of respect."
